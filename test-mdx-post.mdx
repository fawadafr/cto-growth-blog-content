## YAML Formatting Syntax

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files and data exchange. Here are some key points about YAML formatting:

- **Basic Structure**: YAML uses indentation (spaces, not tabs) to represent structure. Each level of indentation represents a nested structure.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Data is represented as key-value pairs, separated by a colon and a space.
  ```yaml
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  ```
- **Lists**: Lists are created using a dash and a space (`- `) before each item.
  ```yaml
  fruits:
    - Apple
    - Banana
    - Cherry
  ```
- **Nested Objects**: Indent child elements under their parent key.
  ```yaml
  address:
    street: 123 Main St
    city: Springfield
    zip: 12345
  ```
- **Comments**: Use `#` for comments.
  ```yaml
  # This is a comment
  ```
- **Strings**: Strings can be unquoted, single-quoted, or double-quoted. Use quotes if the string contains special characters or starts with a reserved character.
  ```yaml
  greeting: "Hello, world!"
  ```
- **Multi-line Strings**: Use `|` for a block (preserves line breaks) or `>` for a folded block (folds newlines to spaces).
  ```yaml
  description: |
    This is a multi-line
    string in YAML.
  ```
- **Booleans and Nulls**: Use `true`, `false`, or `null` (case-insensitive).
  ```yaml
  isActive: true
  value: null
  ```

**Example YAML:**
