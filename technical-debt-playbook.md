Technical debt is inevitable; unmanaged debt is optional. Treat it as a portfolio with explicit strategy.

## Classify

- Friction debt: slows everyday work.
- Risk debt: threatens reliability/security.
- Scale debt: blocks growth.

## Quantify

- Time tax per sprint and teams impacted.
- Risk likelihood x blast radius.
- Sequence risk: dependencies and critical path.

## Paydown

- 10â€“20% capacity budget by default; flex for incidents.
- Bundle with adjacent roadmap work.
- Make outcomes measurable: cycle time, MTTR, on-call load.

Debt is a product. Give it a backlog, owners, and a dashboard.
