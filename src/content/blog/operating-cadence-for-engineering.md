A durable operating cadence creates clarity, speed, and accountability without heroics. Hereâ€™s a lightweight framework.

## Weekly

- Outcome review: commitments vs. actuals, blockers, next bets.
- Quality signals: escaped defects, change failure rate, leading indicators.

## Monthly

- Investment mix: roadmap vs. enablement vs. debt.
- Architecture forum: decisions, ADRs, and paved road updates.

## Quarterly

- Strategy refresh: goals, guardrails, and resourcing.
- Postmortems to playbooks: close the loop and codify learning.

Keep artifacts short, visual, and shareable.
