As organizations grow, the CTO role shifts from hands-on building to enabling leverage across people, platforms, and process. This post outlines a pragmatic path for that evolution.

## What changes first

- Ownership expands from features to outcomes.
- Decisions move from "what to build" to "how we build as a system."
- Time allocation tilts toward strategy, hiring, and enablement.

## Core responsibilities at scale

1. Architecture as a product: clear boundaries, paved roads, and guardrails.
2. Operating cadence: reviews, metrics, and feedback loops that compound.
3. Talent: recruiting bar, growth paths, and succession planning.
4. Portfolio management: balancing bets, core, and enablement work.

## First steps this quarter

- Write down your north-star outcomes and 3 operating metrics.
- Establish a weekly product/engineering review with crisp artifacts.
- Define your paved road and document the golden path for new services.

Start small, make it visible, and iterate.
